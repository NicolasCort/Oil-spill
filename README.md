# Oil spill

## Introduction

This is a project that uses machine learning to detect oil spills . The model is trained on a dataset of satellite images with annotated oil spills to recognize oil spills in new data.


## Libraries

- Python 3.7 or later
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Sklearn
- Xgboost

## Models
I used seven models:

- [RandomForest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest)
- [GradientBoosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting)
- [SVC]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine)
- [DecisionTree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree)
- [AdaBoost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost)
- [XGBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost)
- [MLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron)


## Results

After training the models we got these results:
